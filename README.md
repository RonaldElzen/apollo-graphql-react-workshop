# apollo-graphql-react-workshop

This repository contains Apollo Server and React projects for a workshop GraphQL with React I gave.

The projects are split to make it easier to create codesandboxes. 

## Projects overview

### base-version
The base version projects are a server side which returns book items and a client which displays them.
These projects are used to demonstrate how Apollo server and Apollo client work

#### Workshop assignments:

- Try quering different properties in the playground
- The movies datasource is not connected. Alter the code in a way that you can query the movies data.
- Alter the front-end movies page so that it displays the movies.

### Movies datasource connected
This projects version got the movies datasource connected. As you did the workshop assignments right, you should have a project like this

#### Workshop assignments:

- Retrieve only the genres from movies. We will use them to create a genre filter
- Create a query which only returns movies from a given genre
- Make the selector in the front-end functional

### Movies genre filter query
The genre filter is worked out in this project
If you did the workshop assignments well in the previous project, you should have a comparable project.
